# Repository Organization

This project is an Expo / React Native application written in **TypeScript**. The source code is primarily organized in the following folders:

- `app/` – app entry points and screens
- `components/` – reusable React components
- `constants/` – project-wide configuration and constants
- `assets/` – images and other static files

React components in this code base are implemented as functional components. Make sure any new components follow this style and keep files in the existing directory structure.

# Instructions for Codex

- Always run `npm test` after you make changes and before committing.
- Use TypeScript for any new files and keep new code within the established folders (`app/`, `components/`, etc.).
- Maintain functional React components throughout the project.
- Pull request summaries should clearly describe what the changes do.
