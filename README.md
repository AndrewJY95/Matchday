# Matchday

An Expo/React Native application built with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Make sure you have the Expo CLI available. You can install it globally with:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
   or use `npx expo` with the provided scripts.

## Running the App

Use the npm scripts to launch the development server and target platform:

- **Android**: `npm run android`
- **iOS**: `npm run ios`
- **Web**: `npm run web`

The default `npm start` command launches Expo's development server, letting you choose a platform interactively.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest. Execute tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Environment Notes

This project relies on the Expo development workflow. Ensure Expo CLI is installed and your environment is configured for the desired mobile platforms (Android Studio, Xcode, etc.).
